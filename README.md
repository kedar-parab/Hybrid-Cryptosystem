Steps to run my software:
1. Open CryptoPP/Hybrid
2. Now your folder looks like this: 
3. Open hybridkeygen/Debug and run KeyGen.exe. You will find 2 files being generated as follows:
4. Now, open signaturekeygen/Debug and run KeyGen.exe.
5. Now, open hybridecrypt/Debug and run Eecrypt.exe to generate ecrypted text files.
6. Now, open sign/Debug and Encrypt.exe to generate signature.txt.
7. Lastly, run hybriddecrypt/Debug/Decrypt.exe to generate decrypted plain text.
8. Lastly, run verify/Debug/Decrypt.exe to generate yesno_output.txt

For Symmetric Encryption Schemes, do the following steps:
1. Open CryptoPP/AES_CBC IV=0
2. Now your folder looks like this: 
3. Open KeyGen/Debug and run KeyGen.exe. You will find 3 files being generated as follows:
4. Now, open Encrypt/Debug and run Encrypt.exe to generate cipher text files.
5. Lastly, open Decrypt/Debug and run Decrypt.exe to generate decrypted text files.
6. Similarly, do for other encryption scheme.

Please note: you can change the data inside the plaintext.txt as per your requirement.
